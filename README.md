# CarsGameWebGL

CarsGameWebGL is an implementation of a car game idea in WebGL made for visual computing course with my coworker <a href="https://github.com/asergios">António Sérgio Silva</a>.
The basic idea is to not crash on the traffic that is randomly coming down the road.
The game allows the player to change camera view and day/night time. 

Can be played <a href="https://rafoliveira.github.io/CarsGameWebGL/index.html">here</a>.

The closer the car is to the sidewalk the stronger is the force pushing it to the sidewalk.

## Getting Started

To run the game on your local machine, just open the index.html on a browser. As it's specified in the game you can change the view with the 'c' key and the day and night time with the 'd' key.

### Prerequisites

It is very likely that your browser supports WebGL, you can test that <a href="https://get.webgl.org/">here</a> but if the game does not run make sure you download one that supports it. 

## Built With

* [WebGL](https://get.webgl.org/) - The JavaScript API WebGL
